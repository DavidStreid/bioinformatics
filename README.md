# Bioinformatics Scripts
Collection of tasks related to bioinformatics I've encountered. Each directory accomplishes one of them

## Tasks
* Haplotype Converter: Converts haplotype map to a different reference genome
* Sam Comparison: Compares the numerical fields of two input SAM files created from different aligners (e.g. compares one aligner's MAPQ score to another on the same input FASTQ files)
